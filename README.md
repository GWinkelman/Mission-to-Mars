# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
This project was an introduction to BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and MongoDB. The goal of the project was to use web-scraping tools to get images and their titles of the different Mars hemispheres, store them on Mongo, and then use a web application to show the data from the web-scraping.  Due to a number of technical problems involving MongoDB and Flask working together, I was only able to scrape the images and titles from the Mars hemispheres.
